/**
 * How this page works - Step by Step:
 *
 * 1. Someone visits your website
 * 2. The page checks: "Are they signed in?"
 * 3. If YES:
 *    - Shows "Welcome back, [Name]!"
 *    - Shows the main app (HomeComponent)
 *    - Shows a "Sign Out" button
 * 4. If NO:
 *    - Shows "Welcome to Our App!"
 *    - Shows the SignInComponent button
 *    - Shows some helpful info about signing in
 *
 * Why this is good:
 * - Users know exactly what to do
 * - Signed-in users get right to their stuff
 * - New visitors get a friendly welcome
 * - Everything is secure (NextAuth handles the hard parts)
 *
 * Think of it like a smart receptionist who:
 * - Recognizes returning customers and lets them in
 * - Greets new visitors and helps them get started
 * - Always knows who belongs where
